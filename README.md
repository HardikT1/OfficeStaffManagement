# office_staff_management

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

You need to have flutter installed to be able to build the application. You can download it from here: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install

Then you need to install dependencies with the following command:

- flutter pub get

At last, you need to generate hive models with the following command:

- flutter pub run build_runner build

You will also need an emulator to be able to run the application. You can create a new VM using the AVD Manager inside the IDE

Once the VM is running, you just need to hit the run/debug button, selecting main.dart as the entry point
